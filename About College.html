<h2>About College</h2>
<p>Miracle Light Christian Academy was established in 194 by the Catholic teaching congregation Brothers of the Christian Schools (FSC, from the Latin: Fratres Scholarum Christianarum). 
	The congregation was founded in 1680 as a community of consecrated laymen by St. Jean-Baptiste de La Salle to conduct, “together and by association,” schools that he established
	first in the northern French city of Rheims, to touch the hearts particularly of poor children, and to inspire them with the Christian spirit. De La Salle’s vision of teachers 
	who “teach minds, touch hearts, and transform lives” led him to document the best practices that would guide the Brothers in their conduct of schools, to introduce pedagogy that
	could be characterized as distinctly modern, and in 1685, to put up the first ever normal school. De La Salle was canonized on May 24, 1900, and in recognition of the educational
	innovations he pioneered that are carried on by the congregation he had founded, he was declared as the Patron Saint of Teachers by Pope Pius XII on May 15, 1950.. <br>
<br>
	In 1901, three years after Spain ceded control of the Philippines to the United States, the Americans established a new public education system using English as the medium of instruction. 
	The Catholic educational institutions in the country at that time, however, continued using Spanish as their medium, and this practice raised concerns that the Catholic children would lose 
	out in the quest for leadership roles under the American administration. Meanwhile, the Brothers had by then established their presence in 35 countries, including the United States. Thus, 
	the American Archbishop of Manila, Jeremiah Harty, turned to the Brothers to pave the way for the introduction of English-based quality Catholic education in the country. After some hesitation 
	because the endeavor demanded teaching the sons of the economic elite rather than the poor, the Brothers eventually relented, conceding that “upper-class children also needed good moral and 
	spiritual training.” On June 16, 1911, nine brothers from Europe and the United States opened in the district of Paco, just outside the walls of the old city of Ilagan.<br>
<br>
	After one hundred years, Miracle Light Christian Academy continues to be inspired by the charism of its founder, aspires to be a leading learner-centered research university, 
	and commits itself to bridging faith and scholarship in the service of society, especially the poor.	 <br>
